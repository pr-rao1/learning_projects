# Simple Golang WebServer
This project is a demonstration of how to build a simple webserver with two routes using Golang.
This emulates a website where it searches a database of songs and checks if any songs of 'X Y' artist are present. (enhancement in progress...)

It has three routes:
Default: localhost:8080/  --> The Main page
localhost:8080/info   --> Contains information about the website
localhost:8080/search.html  --> A form is present to input the artist's name and once "search" button is clicked, the search begins.


Note: This is a leanring project made at a very nascent stage with the help of the below resource:
